** Introduction
This software package contains implements sparse univariate Puiseux polynomials
for the computer algebra system [[https://www.oscar-system.org/][OSCAR]].

The ring of Puiseux polynomials over a coefficient field $K$ is defined as

$$ K\{t\} = \left\{ {\sum}_ {k=k_0} ^ {k_1} c_ {k/d} t^ {k/d} \mid d\in\mathbb{Z}_ {>0}, k_0,k_1\in\mathbb{Z}_ {\geq 0}, k_0\leq k_1, c_ {k/d}\in K \right\}. $$

This package is meant to be used in conjunction with OSCAR and should
interoperate with many features in OSCAR, such as

+ working with matrices over $K\{t\}$,
+ working with polynomials over $K\{t\}$,
+ using $K\{t\}$ as codomain for tropical semiring maps.
