* OscarPuiseuxPolynomials.jl

** Introduction
This software package contains implements univariate Puiseux polynomials for the
computer algebra system [[https://www.oscar-system.org/][OSCAR]].

The ring of Puiseux polynomials over a coefficient field $K$ is defined as

$$ K\{t\} = \left\{ \sum_{i\geq k} c_{i/d} t^{i/d} \mid d\in\mathbb{Z}_{>0}, k\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}, c_{i/d}\in K \right\}. $$

This package is meant to be used in conjunction with OSCAR and should
interoperate with many features in OSCAR, such as

+ working with matrices over $K\{t\}$
+ working with polynomials over $K\{t\}$
+ using $K\{t\}$ as codomain for tropical semiring maps
